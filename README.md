# TwitterSentimentAnalysis

Motive: To understand whether analysing tweets is a good representation of people's emotions.

Procedure: 
1. Filter tweets by stopping, stemming.
2. Compare filtered tweets with a lexicon of positive and negative words to generate overall emotional tone of tweet.
3. Generate WordClouds and Bar Graphs to understand what words are used to describe the two presidential candidates.

Conclusion:
Sentiment analysis can be used to understand the emotional direction of the tweets but is not enough to accurately represent the context and hence the emotion expressed.
